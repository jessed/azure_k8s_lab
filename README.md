# F5 BIG-IP Azure Test/Performance Environment
## Overview
This Terraform plan will deploy a K8s lab environment with Azure AKS and F5 BIG-IP. 
BIG-IP can be deployed as standalone instances or as members of a VMSS. 

### Pre-deployment
Ensure you update variables in the following files prior to deployment:
- vars.tf
- v_bigip.auto.tfvars
- v_clients.auto.tfvars
- v_storage.auto.tfvars
- v_aks.auto.tfvars


## Modules
- resource_group
- network
- nsg
- log_analytics
- load-balancer
- pls
- user_assigned_identity
- vmss
- k8s
- clients
- vmss
- bigip
- vnet_peering

## Caveats / Notes
- The use of PAYGO vs BYOL licnsing is controlled by v_vmss.auto.tfvars: use_paygo
  - If BYOL licensing is used (use_paygo = true), the BIG-IQ variables in vars.tf populated.
- If the names of files to be retrieved (bigip.conf, iAppLX packages) begin with http or https the file is considered external and the file name will be treated like a URL.
  - Each filename is evaluated independently and treated accordingly.
  - If the file name does *not* begin with https/https the file will be retrieved from an Azure Secure Container.
  - The package assumes that a UserAssigned identity has been provided when retrieving data from a Secure Container.
  - The UserAssigned Identity should be specified in secrets.json:uai_name
